## 📘 Key Learnings

While working on this project, I learned:

### 🔹 HTML Semantics
How semantic tags help describe the purpose of content clearly:

- `<header>` for the page title and heading
- `<main>` to wrap the main content
- `<section>` to divide content logically
- `<article>` for individual content blocks
- `<footer>` for page-end information
- `<hr>` for separating sections visually

### 🔹 Proper HTML Structure
- Writing clean and readable HTML
- Using correct heading levels (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`)
- Organizing content for better clarity

### 🔹 Accessibility Basics
- Semantic HTML improves screen-reader support
- Makes pages more understandable for users and browsers
